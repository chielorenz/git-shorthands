# Git shorthands

Over the years I've collected a few shorthands to make using Git from the command line faster and easier, more details on [this blog post](https://chielorenz.com/blog/git-shorthands).

## Try it out

Download and source the commands file:

```shell
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chielorenz/git-shorthands/main/git-shorthands.sh
source ./git-shorthands.sh
```

Now you should able to list all available commands by running ```glist``` in your terminal.
